* my wasm page setup/site

Oi wots all this then? Mostly me just avoiding learning how to do any web programming by abusing wasm to make my "web page". Basically my page is now a video game. Cause... reasons I guess it seemed like a good idea at the time.

** How to build this stuff?

I've no clue why anyone would want to build this but me or github actions but... you're gonna need nix installed. Thats well outside of the scope of this readme.

Note there is also a .envrc file so you can use direnv with nix too if you just cd into the dir.

To run all checks/unit tests formatting tests etc...

#+begin_src sh
nix flake check -L
#+end_src

Linux build, should work on xorg or wayland but not well tested whatever I run is what I test with. Note that macos

#+begin_src sh
nix build .#mitchty
#+end_src

Windows x86_64 cross compilation build, note only builds on a linux system won't work on macos nix/arm basically.

#+begin_src sh
nix build .#mitchty-release-windows
#+end_src
